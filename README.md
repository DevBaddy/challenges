## Inspiration

I wanted to have proficient skills in the Frontend world so I decided to take on these challenges that refined my skills.

## Challenges

Mastering some of the advanced CSS, such as animations, positioning, and more.

## Lessons Learned

Through all of these challenges, I have learned about the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In HTML, I learned about structuring. In CSS, I learned basic CSS properties and moved onto more advanced topics such as Flexbox, Grid, and animations. In JavaScript, I learned the basics of scripting and making calls to API's.
