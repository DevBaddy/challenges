## Inspiration

I wanted to become proficient in frontend development, so I decided to take on these challenges to refine my skills.

## Challenges

Mastering advanced CSS, such as animations, positioning, and more.

## Lessons Learned

Through these challenges, I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In HTML, I learned about structuring. In CSS, I started with basic properties and moved on to more advanced topics such as Flexbox, Grid, and animations. In JavaScript, I learned the basics of scripting and making API calls.
